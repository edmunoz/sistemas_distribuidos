### Camel

Click [Camel](#/jmx/attributes?tab=camel) in the top navigation bar to view all the running Camel Contexts in the current JVM. (The selection will not appear on the navigation bar if there is no Camel running).

If you select a CamelContext, Route or Endpoint you can then view the **Attributes** or **Charts** of the  various underlying MBeans.

You can use the **Diagram** tab to view a graphical representation of the running routes along with real time runtime metrics. If you select a single route instance then the diagram just shows that route only.

If you select a **Route** you can then use the **Trace** tab to perform diagnostic tracing of routes; to see every version of each message as it flows around a route.
